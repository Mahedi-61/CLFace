## Introduction
We introduce CLFace, a continual learning framework designed to preserve and incrementally extend the learned knowledge. CLFace eliminates the classification layer, resulting in a resource-efficient FR model that remains fixed throughout lifelong learning and provides label-free supervision to a student model, making it suitable for open-set face recognition during incremental steps. We introduce an objective function that employs feature-level distillation to reduce drift between feature maps of the student and teacher models across multiple stages. Additionally, it incorporates a geometry-preserving distillation scheme to maintain the orientation of the teacher modelâ€™s feature embedding. Furthermore, a contrastive knowledge distillation is incorporated to continually enhance the discriminative power of the feature representation by matching similarities between new identities.
